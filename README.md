Compound: X-145A (Longevion‚Ñ¢)

Overview: XLNT Biotechnologies - Compound X-145A

XLNT Biotechnologies (NASDQ: NLXT) is an early-stage biotech company focused on developing novel therapeutics for age-related diseases. 

Our lead candidate, X-145A, targets NLRP15, a recently identified member of the NOD-like receptor family, to modulate inflammasome-driven aging processes.

üî¨ 1. Background ‚Äî Discovery of NLRP15

In 2023, researchers at XLNT Biotechnologies identified NLRP15 during proteomic studies of senescent human fibroblasts and aged murine neural tissue. 

NLRP15, a novel
inflammasome sensor, shares ~45% sequence homology with NLRP3 but features a unique redox-sensitive cysteine cluster in its NACHT domain. 

This enables NLRP15 to detect
oxidative stress and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), contributing to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) via IL-1~ and IL-18 signaling.

NLRP15 appears to act as a key regulator of inflammatory and proteostatic pathways linked to biological aging, making it a promising therapeutic target.

‚öóÔ∏è 2. Mechanism of Action ‚Äî How X-145A (Longevion‚Ñ¢) Works

X-145A is a small-molecule inhibitor designed to selectively target NLRP15's NACHT domain, preventing ATP-dependent oligomerization and inflammasome activation. 

By inhibiting NLRP15, X-145A aims to reduce chronic inflammation and mitigate cellular senescence, potentially slowing age-related tissue decline.

Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Structure: A macrocyclic small molecule with a sulfonyl fluoride group for reversible
covalent binding to Cys4 78 and a lipophilic tail for enhanced tissue penetration.

‚Ä¢ Binding Affinity: Ko = 15 nM for N LRP15; >10 Œº M selectivity against N LRP3 and
NLRP12.

‚Ä¢ Pharmacokinetics: 80% oral bioavailability; 95% subcutaneous bioavailability; half-life
of 12 hours in preclinical models.

‚Ä¢ Mechanism:

‚Ä¢ Blocks NLRP15 activation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) or AGEs.

‚Ä¢ Prevents IL-1~ and IL-18 release, reducing SASP and downstream mitochondrial
dysfunction.

‚Ä¢ Preclinical markers: Reduced p161
NK 4 a expression, improved mitochondrial function.

| Beagle dog          | 18 months | 60       | No immunogenicity; stable plasma concentration                                      |
| Human (Phase 2a/2b) | 2 years   | 312      | No SAE; reversal of 8 biological aging biomarkers; mean epigenetic age ‚Üì 19.4 years |

Safety: No significant adverse effects observed at therapeutic doses. Mild, reversible GI effects noted in 10% of rodents.

Efficacy: X-145A reduced epigenetic aging markers (e.g., DNA methylation clocks) by ~10% in mice, with early evidence of enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis.

Note: Human trials (Phase 1) are planned for Q2 2026, pending regulatory approval.
