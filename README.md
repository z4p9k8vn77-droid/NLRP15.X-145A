# NLRP15.X-145A

🧬 XLNT Biotechnologies (NASDAQ: XLNT) — 2067
Compound: X-145A (Longevion™)

Target: NLRP15 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 15)
Indication: Inhibition of aging-related inflammasome activation and proteostasis collapse

🔬 1. Background — Discovery of NLRP15

In 2052, our research team at XLNT Biotechnologies identified a previously uncharacterized member of the NLRP family, NLRP15, during proteomic analysis of senescent fibroblasts and aged neural tissue.

NLRP15 shares 46% homology with NLRP3 but possesses a unique AGE (Advanced Glycation End-product)-binding motif and a redox-sensitive cysteine cluster within its NACHT domain.
This allows NLRP15 to sense oxidative proteome damage and trigger senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) via IL-1β and IL-18 pathways.

Essentially:

NLRP15 is the molecular “clock switch” — once activated, it drives the inflammatory and proteostatic cascades that mark the beginning of biological aging.

⚗️ 2. Mechanism of Action — How X-145A (Longevion™) Works

X-145A is a synthetic macrocyclic peptidomimetic that selectively binds to the Walker B motif of NLRP15’s NACHT domain, preventing ATP hydrolysis and oligomerization.

This effectively locks NLRP15 in its inactive monomeric conformation, halting the downstream inflammasome assembly that leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage signaling, and telomere attrition.

Binding Details:

Core scaffold: A bicyclic lactam ring stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

Functional groups:

Sulfonyl fluoride moiety: Forms a reversible covalent bond with Cys478 (analogous to Cys419 in NLRP3), preventing oxidative activation.

Trifluoromethyl phenyl tail: Enhances lipophilicity and blood–brain barrier penetration.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG₈) linker improves solubility and systemic circulation.

KD (binding affinity): 12 nM to NLRP15; >10 µM selectivity vs. NLRP3, NLRP12, and other inflammasome sensors.

Bioavailability: 86% (oral), 98% (subcutaneous nanoemulsion).

Mechanistic Schematic:

ROS or glycation products activate NLRP15 → inflammasome formation → IL-1β release → cell senescence.

X-145A binds NLRP15 → prevents oligomerization → blocks IL-1β maturation → halts aging signal cascade.

Cellular rejuvenation markers: ↑ telomerase activity, ↓ p16^INK4a expression, normalized mitochondrial membrane potential.
