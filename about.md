XLNT Biotechnologies is an early-stage biotech company advancing innovative therapies for age-related diseases through inflammasome modulation. Headquartered in Cambridge, MA, XLNT was founded in 2022 with a commitment to rigorous science, ethical development, and equitable healthcare.​

The company’s lead therapeutic candidate is X-145A (Longevion™), a synthetic small-molecule inhibitor targeting the fictional NLRP15 inflammasome—a novel sensor identified by XLNT in 2023 during research on aging human and murine tissues. NLRP15 regulates key inflammatory and proteostatic pathways that drive biological aging, featuring a unique redox-sensitive cysteine cluster in its NACHT domain. X-145A blocks ATP-dependent oligomerization and activation of NLRP15, thereby reducing chronic inflammation and cellular senescence. The compound exhibits high specificity and favorable pharmacokinetics, with no major toxicity observed in preclinical models.​

Recent Phase 2 preclinical trials demonstrate that X-145A effectively reverses biomarkers of aging and improves mitochondrial health across multiple animal models with strong safety profiles. Early human data suggest a reduction in epigenetic age and no serious adverse effects at therapeutic doses. XLNT plans to initiate Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers in 2026, aiming for accelerated regulatory approval by 2030.​

XLNT operates at the intersection of molecular biology, clinical science, and translational research with a vision to delay the onset of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular decline, and frailty. The global anti-aging therapeutics market is projected to reach $93 billion by 2030, and XLNT is positioned to deliver transformative solutions targeting chronic inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases.​
