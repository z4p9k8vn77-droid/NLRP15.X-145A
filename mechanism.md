## Mechanism of Action

X-145A binds selectively to the NLRP15 inflammasome complex, inhibiting its activation cascade. This prevents the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-18 and IL-33, which are implicated in age-related cellular damage. The compound mimics endogenous regulatory peptides but with enhanced stability and bioavailability.
